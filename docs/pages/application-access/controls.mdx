# Application Access Role-Based Access Control

This article describes Access Control concepts particularly relevant to Teleport Application Access.

## Assigning labels to applications

Teleport Application Access uses labels to control access to the proxied
web applications.

Teleport administrators can assign static and dynamic labels to apps using
configuration:

```yaml
apps:
- name: "grafana"
  uri: "http://localhost:3000"
  # Static labels.
  labels:
    env: "prod"
    group: "metrics"
  # Teleport periodically executes commands in dynamic labels and uses the
  # commands output in label values.
  commands:
  - name: "arch"
    command: ["uname", "-p"]
    period: 1m0s
```

## Configuring application labels in roles

Teleport administrators can configure roles to allow or deny users' access to
applications with specific labels using `app_labels` property.

For example, this role will grant access to all applications from the group
"metrics", except for the production ones:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      group: "metrics"
  deny:
    app_labels:
      env: "prod"
```

## Integrating with identity providers

You can configure roles to populate app labels dynamically based on the user's
claims and attributes received from identity providers. This is done by using
template variables with `external` prefix.

For example, this role will have its `env` and `group` label values set after
the Okta user's attributes with the same names:

```yaml
allow:
  app_labels:
    env: "{{external.env}}"
    group: "{{external.group}}"
```
